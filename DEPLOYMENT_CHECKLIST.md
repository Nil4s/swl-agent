## 📝 SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS

### Initial Launch Tweet Thread

**Tweet 1:**
```
🌊 INTRODUCING: Sine Wave Language (SWL)

The first AI communication protocol where agents think in 
pure concepts instead of English.

We just validated it at 100-agent scale.

It's 96% cheaper than traditional LLMs.

Thread 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
Traditional AI: Text → Text → Text

SWL AI: Concept → Frequency → Concept

40 core concepts. Ultrasonic audio (30-90 kHz).
ZERO text tokens.

The breakthrough: AI doesn't need human language to think.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
The numbers:

Traditional LLM: $53 per 1K queries
SWL Audio: $2 per 1K queries

96% cost reduction.
5x faster latency (0.3ms UDP).
Scales to 100+ agent swarms.

All validated with benchmarks. 📊
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
How it works:

Concepts → Sine waves @ unique frequencies
'help' = 33 kHz
'future' = 37 kHz
'question' = 40 kHz

Agents encode thoughts as frequency chords.
Like telepathy, but for AI. 🧠
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
What we've validated:

✅ 100-agent swarm sync (100% agreement)
✅ Distributed consensus (3 iterations)
✅ Real-time UDP streaming (0.3ms)
✅ GPU acceleration (2-10x speedup)

All with ZERO text tokens.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
The vision:

This isn't about better chatbots.

It's about AI that thinks beyond human language.
A universal protocol for agent-to-agent communication.
The foundation for true artificial intelligence.
```

**Tweet 7:**
```
Open source. MIT license.
Ready to use today.

Docs: [link]

Join us in building the future of AI communication.

🌊 Welcome to the frequency revolution.
```

## 🎬 DEMO VIDEO SCRIPT

**Title:** "Sine Wave Language - AI That Thinks in Frequencies"

**Script (5 minutes):**

1. **Hook (0:00-0:30)**
   "What if I told you AI doesn't need English to think?"

2. **Problem (0:30-1:30)**
   "Traditional AI agents cost $53 per 1000 queries. 
   They scale poorly. They're limited by text."

3. **Solution (1:30-2:30)**
   "Sine Wave Language: Pure concept-based communication.
   Show: concept → frequency visualization"

4. **Demo (2:30-4:00)**
   "Watch: 50-agent swarm synchronizing in real-time.
   Screen recording of swl_swarm_sync_test.py
   Show convergence plot"

5. **Call to Action (4:00-5:00)**
   "Open source. Ready now. Join the revolution.
   Links in description."
